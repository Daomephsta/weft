# Weft
Weft is an open source project project that aims to provide a set of [Unpick definitions](https://github.com/WeaveMC/unpick/wiki/Unpick-Format) that covers every inlined constant in the Minecraft: Java Edition codebase. The intent is to make it easier for modders to understand the decompiled code, making mod creation a little bit easier.

### Usage
The only way to apply sets of Unpick definitions (e.g Weft) right now is [Warp](https://github.com/WeaveMC/warp), an addon for [Fabric's](https://github.com/FabricMC) Gradle plugin, [Loom](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loom). No equivalent for ForgeGradle is currently available.
